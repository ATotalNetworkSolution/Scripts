This is a demonstration of the package deployment feature. When you schedule this package deployment, your Server will first download the package from the Global Subscription Service. Afterward, the Patch Agent will check the Server to determine if there are any tasks for the Agent computer. When the scheduled time is reached, the Patch Agent will download the file Patch_deploy_demo.txt and store it in the system temp directory.
