# This script gives an example of how to deallocate an Azure VM from Azure CLI
# NOTE there is difference in STOP and DEALLOCATE. 
#       Stop turns the OS off, but still incurs Azure compute + storage cost. Deallocate turns the Azure VM off, only cost is storage
# Change the ResourceGroupName to match the ResourceGroup the VM is in
# Change the VMName to match the actual name of the VM
# The "--no-wait" cmdlet will cause the script to move to the next line of the code without waiting for the line to finish
#       Without the "--no-wait" cmdlet the script would wait until the VM reports that it is completely down before shutting the next VM
# Copy the following line(s) into CLI Powershell

az vm deallocate --name VMName1 --no-wait --resource-group ResourceGroupName
az vm deallocate --name VMName2 --no-wait --resource-group ResourceGroupName
