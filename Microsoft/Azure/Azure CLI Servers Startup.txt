# This script gives an example of how to start an Azure VM from Azure CLI
# Change the ResourceGroupName to match the ResourceGroup the VM is in
# Change the VMName to match the actual name of the VM
# The "--no-wait" cmdlet will cause the script to move to the next line of the code without waiting for the line to finish
#       Without the "--no-wait" cmdlet the script would wait until the VM reports that it is up before starting the next VM
# Copy the following line(s) into CLI Powershell

az vm start --name VMName1 --no-wait --resource-group ResourceGroupName
az vm start --name VMName2 --no-wait --resource-group ResourceGroupName
